This is version Beta 0.3

It is suggested that the power of B,M, and P be reduced to .66 power, and that when you keyframe, the power should globally be set to .66

In "LipSync Importer & Blinker" it is suggested to use an ease in, and ease out of 5.A Key Value of .66. A hold of 1 and an offset between -2 and +2 depending on the timing in the .dat file from Papagayo-NG.
