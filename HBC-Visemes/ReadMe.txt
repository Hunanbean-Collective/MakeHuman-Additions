Here is a full 39 Viseme set for use with MakeHuman in coordination with Papagayo-NG and Blender

These were designed with a combination of Targets by:
montybot   https://github.com/montybot/FACSHuman
Thomas Larsson   https://bitbucket.org/Diffeomorphic/
Hunanbean   https://github.com/Hunanbean-Collective/


NOTE: This portion is only required if you want to have access to the .target files themselves. It is Not required to use.
Please see the ReadMe in the other folders, which is probably what you are looking for.


Copy the MHC-Visemes folder into your MakeHuman Custom folder
On Windows, it should be in a location similar to -
C:\Users\*YourUserName*\Documents\makehuman\v1py3\data\custom


It is suggested that the power of B,M, and P be reduced to .66 power, and that when you keyframe, the power should globally be set to .66

In "LipSync Importer & Blinker" it is suggested to use an ease in, and ease out of 4. A Key Value of .66 to 1.0. A hold of 1 and an offset of your choosing, if required, depending on the timing in the .dat file from Papagayo-NG.

Note that Papagayo-NG is now automated with speech recognition and phoneme alignment. An offset will probably not be required.
