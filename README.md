Resources for use with MakeHuman

More information in readme files in the individual folders



Here is a full 39 Viseme set for use with MakeHuman in coordination with Papagayo-NG and Blender

These were designed with a combination of Targets by:

montybot   https://github.com/montybot/FACSHuman

Thomas Larsson   https://bitbucket.org/Diffeomorphic/

Hunanbean   https://github.com/Hunanbean-Collective/


Please note, this works well right now, as it is. The only future changes would be to perfect the mouth shapes further.
If you have any questions, open and 'issue' and let me know.
