# MakeHuman-Additions
Resources for use with MakeHuman

More information in readme files in the individual folders

these are ready to use, but i will be putting together more detailed instructions for anyone who needs them


Here is a full 39 Viseme set for use with MakeHuman in coordination with Papagayo-NG and Blender

These were designed with a combination of Targets by:

montybot   https://github.com/montybot/FACSHuman

Thomas Larsson   https://bitbucket.org/Diffeomorphic/

Hunanbean   https://github.com/Hunanbean-Collective/


This is beta 0.4 More accurate and finalized version coming soon

Note: This is a fully functioning, useable project as it is.

Due to limited interest, i am focused on other projects instead of rapidly updating this one.
Please note, this works well right now, as it is. The only future changes would be to perfect the mouth shapes further.
If you have any questions, open and 'issue' and let me know.
